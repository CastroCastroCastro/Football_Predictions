# Football_Predictions
In this project, I predicted the winner of football matches in the English Premier League (EPL).
You will need the csv.file to run the Colab notebook.

Project Steps:

Clean the data and get it ready for machine learning using pandas.

Make predictions about who will win a match using scikit-learn.

Measure error and improve our predictions.
